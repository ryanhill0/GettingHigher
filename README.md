# GettingHigher
 This is a collection of files for a game that I created using UNITY ENGINE. It was made to become a doodle jump clone that had its own unique artstyle, and would automatically generate the level ahead of the player. Unlike doodle jump the player can climb the platforms vertically by touching the sides of the platform. Should be run on unity engine
